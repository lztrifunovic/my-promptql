        Required field that serves as the main reference for all SAR-related operations.
    - name: customer_id
      type: int_32
      description: |
        Links to the customer who initiated or is associated with the suspicious transaction.
        May be null for third-party or anonymous suspicious activities.
        Critical for customer risk profiling and PEP analysis.
    - name: transaction_id
      type: int_32
      description: |
        References the specific financial transfer that triggered this SAR.
        Essential for calculating processing times and investigating transaction patterns.
        Links to financial_transfers table for complete transaction details.
